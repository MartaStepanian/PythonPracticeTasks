Python is an object-oriented and high-level programming language which is easy to write, read, and debug. 
In the exercises, I applied several fundamental programming concepts which helped me better understand the lexical structure of Python, such as:
* Getting input values from the user
* Making comparisons
* Making mathematical calculations
* Displaying results or messages in the console
